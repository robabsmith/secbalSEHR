Without presenting any reliable alternative time series the attempt is made to show the implausibilities and inconsistencies in Hoffmann sendeavour. This is done in two ways: first alternative plausible levels of relevant national accounting measures are calculated and discussed in order to demonstrate the direction of a specific bias and to indicate the consequences of certain assumptions (e.g. weighting schemes) in Hoffmann's figures. Secondly, I try to establish how Hoffmann S time series were in fact calculated. A preliminary conclusion suggests the construction of a new independent benchmark estimate for output before 1913. Should this diverge significantly from the Hoffmann-level a new attempt to reconstruct the German national accounts will be necessary.},

It was the 1920s and the 1930s, however, that saw the real breakthrough. In Sweden it took the form of HNA, and in the other countries the form of NA, with Denmark and Norway in the lead. The commodity-flow method provided the common characteristic. Later developments somewhat differed in the individual countries. All participated in the Kuznets project ofHNA. Denmark and Norway had obtained new series by the mid 1960s and the early 1970s. Sweden and Finland came later, at the end of the 1980s, and consequently today have the most up-to-date series. These though reveal differences in methodology and a new project has been started, whose aim is to revive the spirit of Nordic community.},

abstract = {ABSTRACTThis article provides historical account of wealth accumulation and composition in Sweden during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. A detailed account on capital formation during the industrialisation process shows that produced capital grew faster than natural capital from the 1850s. Natural capital was changing from a predominance of forest towards crop land as the main asset in the early twentieth century. Produced capital was largely bounded in the agriculture sector up till the second half of the nineteenth century. Heavy investments in the infrastructure sector and later in the manufacturing section changed the produced capital structure and thereby lowered transport costs and return of investment in manufacturing and services; providing incentives for accumulating the stock of produced capital and enhance consumption and living standard. The return on capital was dispersed from the outset of the period but has converged over time.},

abstract = {An overview of exchange rate regimes in Norway since 1816 is provided in a table which is divided into five sections; corresponding to the parts of the Norwegian monetary history defined and discussed in Eitrheim, Klovland and {\O}ksendal (2016). Measured by the frequency of formal regime changes, the two parts of history before World War I were the two most stable. Several years pass between each regime change, and nominal stability was first established and then maintained. Long lasting formal regime stability was due to the absence of large external shocks to the economy. It was also due to a modest expected role for economic policy during the periods of domestic economic stress that the country experienced. Wars and large terms of trade shocks, in addition to growing ambitions regarding policy contributions to domestic economic stability, resulted in more frequent formal regime changes during the next two parts of Norwegian monetary history, covering the period from 1914 to 1986. This period of time was also characterized by nominal volatility. Finally, the "long return" to monetary stability in the most recent period after 1986 has simultaneously represented a return to fewer formal regime changes.},

abstract = {Recent studies have found that capital moves 'uphill' from poor to rich countries, and brings little or no growth dividend when it does flow into poor economies. We show that Europe does not conform to this paradigm. In the European experience of financial integration, capital has flown from rich to poor countries, and such inflows have been associated with significant acceleration of income convergence. Analysing broader samples of countries, we find that 'downhill' capital flows tend to be observed above certain thresholds in institutional quality and financial integration. But Europe remains different even when allowing for such threshold effects, and its experience is similar to that of interstate flows within the United States. Our findings are consistent with the notion that financial diversification reduces countries' incentives to save in order to self-insure against specific shocks.},

To address this problem, we construct a de facto classification based on data on exchange rates and international reserves from all IMF-reporting countries over the period 1974–2000, which we believe provides a meaningful alternative for future empirical work on the topic. The classification sheds new light on several stylized facts previously reported in the literature. In particular, we find that the de facto pegs have remained stable throughout the last decade, although an increasing number of them shy away from an explicit commitment to a fixed regime (“hidden pegs”). We confirm the hollowing out hypothesis but show that it does not apply to countries with limited access to capital markets. We also find that pure floats are associated with only relatively minor nominal exchange rate volatility and that the recent increase in the number of de jure floats goes hand in hand with an increase in the number of de facto dirty floats (“fear of floating”).},

abstract = {This article concerns the corporate responses to the economic integration process from 1973 to 2008 in two small, open European countries, Denmark and Sweden. It focuses on strategic relations regarding the integration process and analyses the changing diversification patterns and internationalisation levels. The hypothesis from the economic integration literature indicates that we could expect a high degree of core business focus combined with a high degree of internationalisation concurrently with the economic integration process. The Danish case confirmed this prediction in a clear and substantial way, while the Swedish diversification pattern was marked by the continuous importance of diversification in the period from 1973 to 1993. This confirms the findings of Whittington and Mayer, who investigated the development of the largest British, French and German manufacturing enterprises. But the result also indicates that diversification perhaps proved to be less important after 1993 when the process of ‘Europeanisation' dynamics was succeeded by the globalisation processes including the fast growing economies in South East Asia.},

The treatment of identification now is no more credible than in the early 1970s but escapes challenge because it is so much more opaque. Macroeconomic theorists dismiss mere facts by feigning an obtuse ignorance about such simple assertions as "tight monetary policy can cause a recession." Their models attribute fluctuations in aggregate variables to imaginary causal forces that are not influenced by the action that any person takes. A parallel with string theory from physics hints at a general failure mode of science that is triggered when respect for highly regarded leaders evolves into a deference to authority that displaces objective fact from its position as the ultimate determinant of scientific truth.},

While both constrained and unconstrained firms may be willing to absorb all the directed credit that they can get (because it may be cheaper than other sources of credit), constrained firms will use it to expand production, while unconstrained firms will primarily use it as a substitute for other borrowing. We apply these observations to firms in India that became eligible for directed credit as a result of a policy change in 1998, and lost eligibility as a result of the reversal of this reform in 2000, and to smaller firms that were already eligible for the preferential credit before 1998 and remained eligible in 2000. Comparing the trends in the sales and the profits of these two groups of firms, we show that there is no evidence that directed credit is being used as a substitute for other forms of credit. Instead, the credit was used to finance more production–there},

The theoretical literature emphasizes several reasons for departures from this hypothesis. However, the empirical literature is inconclusive. When Ricardian equivalence is tested in a life–cycle framework the hypothesis is usually rejected, while when the empirical analysis is based on optimizing models, it is usually accepted.},

This is implemented in an interacted panel VAR framework in which all coefficient parameters are allowed to change continuously with the debt-to-GDP ratio. We find that responses to government spending shocks exhibit strong nonlinear behavior. While the overall cumulative effect of a spending shock on real GDP is positive and significant at moderate debt-to-GDP ratios, this effect turns negative as the ratio increases. The total cumulative effect on the trade balance as a share of GDP is negative at first but switches sign at higher levels of debt. Consequently, depending on the degree of public indebtedness, our results accommodate long-run fiscal multipliers that are greater and smaller than one or even negative as well as twin deficit and twin divergence behavior within one sample and time period. From a policy perspective, these results lend additional support to increased prudence at high public debt ratios because the effectiveness of fiscal stimuli to boost economic activity or resolve external imbalances may not be guaranteed.},

On average, across estimation methods, a strengthening in the fiscal balance by 1 percentage point of GDP is associated with a current account improvement of about 0.3 percentage point of GDP. With our preferred estimation method (quarterly structural VAR using government consumption to identify fiscal policy shocks), the relationship is stronger, in the 0.3--0.5 range. The association is stronger in emerging markets and low-income countries; in economies that are more open to trade; and when the economy is somewhat overheated to begin with. The effect is, however, notably weaker during episodes of large fiscal policy and current account changes, suggesting that fiscal policy may have a more limited role in correcting large external imbalances.},

Estimation results based on this measure of fiscal policy changes suggest that a 1 percent of GDP fiscal consolidation raises the current account balance-to-GDP ratio by about 0.6 percentage point, supporting the twin deficits hypothesis. This effect is substantially larger than that obtained using standard measures of the fiscal policy stance, such as the change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance.},

abstract = {Current account imbalances have increased steadily in rich countries over the past 20 years. While the U.S. current account deficit dominates the numbers and the news, other countries, especially within the euro area, are also running large deficits. These deficits are different from the Latin American deficits of the early 1980s, or the Mexican deficit of the early 1990s. They involve rich countries; they reflect mostly private saving and investment decisions, and fiscal deficits often play a marginal role; and the deficits are financed mostly through equity, FDI foreign direct investment, and own-currency bonds rather than through bank lending. Yet there appears to be a widely shared concern that these deficits are too large, and government intervention is required. My purpose is to examine the logic of this argument. I ask the following question: Assume that deficits reflect private saving and investment decisions. Assume also that people and firms have rational expectations. Should the government intervene, and, if so, how? To answer the question, I construct a simple benchmark. In the benchmark, the outcome is ``first best'' and there is no need nor justification for government intervention. I then introduce simple distortions in either goods, labor, or financial markets, and characterize the equilibrium in each case. I derive optimal policy and the implications for the current account. I show that optimal policy may or may not lead to smaller current account deficits. I see the model and the extensions very much as a first pass. Sharper conclusions require a better understanding of the exact nature and the extent of distortions, which we do not have yet. Such understanding is needed, however, to improve the quality of the current debate.},

abstract = {The purpose of the paper is not to make short-term predictions about the life expectancy of the current economic expansion in the United States, but to determine if the present stance of fiscal and trade policy is appropriate looking to the medium turn. The expansion has been generated by economic processes that are unsustainable--processes in private saving, private borrowing, and asset prices that have fueled the growth of demand against a negative impetus both from fiscal policy and from net export demand. Given unchanged fiscal policy and the consensus forecast for growth in the rest of the world, continued expansion requires that private expenditure continue to expand relative to income on a record and growing scale, and it seems impossible that this source of growth can be forthcoming indefinitely, although it may well continue into next year. When private demand falters, it will be necessary to bring about a substantial relaxation of fiscal policy and to ensure that there is a structural improvement in the United States's balance of payments.},

abstract = {This paper advances three fundamental propositions regarding money: (1) As R. W. Clower (1965) famously put it, money buys goods and goods buy money, but goods do not buy goods. (2) Money is always debt; it cannot be a commodity from the first proposition because, if it were, that would mean that a particular good is buying goods. (3) Default on debt is possible. These three propositions are used to build a theory of money that is linked to common themes in the heterodox literature on money. The approach taken here is integrated with Hyman Minsky's (1986) work (which relies heavily on the work of his dissertation adviser, Joseph Schumpeter [1934]); the endogenous money approach of Basil Moore; the French-Italian circuit approach; Paul Davidson's (1978) interpretation of John Maynard Keynes, which relies on uncertainty; Wynne Godley's approach, which relies on accounting identities; the “K” distribution theory of Keynes, Michal Kalecki, Nicholas Kaldor, and Kenneth Boulding; the sociological approach of Ingham; and the chartalist, or state money, approach (A. M. Innes, G. F. Knapp, and Charles Goodhart). Hence, this paper takes a somewhat different route to develop the more typical heterodox conclusions about money.},

Consumption varies countercyclically, but it is offset by rising taxes as opposed to saving, suggesting that "consumption smoothing" by households as featured in much macro theory is not empirically important. Procyclicality of private net borrowing is countered by a countercyclical government deficit along traditional lines. In terms of trends, "twin" fiscal and foreign deficits appear infrequently, with the household and external deficits being much more closely related. The former is linked to a strong upward trend in health-care spending as a share of disposable income, with a corresponding downward trend in saving after the early 1980s.},

Contrary to the established post-Keynesian, or evolutionary, view, this paper argues that money has always been endogenous, irrespective of the historical period. Instead of the evolutionary theory of money and banking that can be traced back to Chick (1986), this paper puts forward a revolu- tionary definition of endogenous money consistent with many aspects of post-Keynesian eco- nomics as well as with the monetary circuit approach. This alternative starting point leads to the conclusion that money is indeed ‘always and everywhere' an endogenous phenomenon. This analysis rests on the nature of debt, the essential role of a settlement institution, and the link between production, money and income.},

abstract = {Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer electronic payment system that operates as an independent currency. This paper is a philosophical investigation of the ontological constitution of Bitcoin. Using Slavoj {\v{Z}}i{\v{z}}ek's ontological triad of the real, the symbolic and the imaginary, the paper distinguishes between three ideal typical theories of money: commodity theory, fiat theory, and credit theory. The constitution of Bitcoin is analysed by comparing the currency to each of these ideal types. It is argued that Bitcoin is commodity money without gold, fiat money without a state, and credit money without debt. In conclusion, it is suggested that Bitcoin poses an ideological challenge to conventional forms of money in so far as it not only provokes sedimented beliefs about money but also exposes the forms of exploitation, risk and even violence inherent in the existing system of state authorized credit money.},

abstract = {This paper attempts to bring together several of Hyman P. Minsky's insights in order to suggest a relationship between the state's ability to tax and the money of the economy. Minsky recognized that money represents an IOU or promise to pay and that "acceptability" is its important feature. He further recognized that the State can play an important role in determining whose IOUs will be accepted (both publicly and privately). I will argue that support for the Chartalist vision of money as a 'creature of the State' can be found in Minsky. Finally, I will apply the Chartalist theory to Minsky's notion of a 'hierarchy of money' in order to suggest that the State determines not only the unit in which all of the monies in the hierarchy are denominated but also influences the positioning of certain monies within the hierarchy.},

@techreport{bundesbank2017,
abstract = {The accommodative non-standard monetary policy measures taken by the Eurosystem in response to the nancial and sovereign debt crisis caused the reserves of (commercial) banks in the euro area to increase sharply. In spite of this, the annual growth rate of the monetary aggregate M3 has remained at a moderate level over the past two years, reigniting interest in the connection between the creation of reserves and growth in the broader monetary aggregate. It su ces to look at the creation of (book) money as a set of straightforward accounting entries to grasp that money and credit are created as the result of complex interactions between banks, non-banks and the central bank. And a bank's ability to grant loans and create money has noth- ing to do with whether it already has excess reserves or deposits at its disposal. Instead, various economic and regulatory factors constrain the process of money creation. From the perspective of banks, the creation of money is limited by the need for individual banks to lend pro tably and also by micro and macroprudential regulations. Non-banks' demand for credit and portfolio behaviour likewise act to curtail the creation of money. The central bank in uences the money and credit creation process in normal times through its interest rate policy, which affects the nancing and portfolio decisions of banks and non-banks through various transmission channels. Non-standard monetary policy measures, too, have effects on the creation of money and credit. One such unconventional measure, the Eurosystem's asset purchase programme, differs from interest rate policy in that it directly boosts the supply of reserves. Moreover, purchase pro- grammes structured in this manner have an immediate expansionary impact (originating directly from the asset purchase) on the stock of money held by non-banks, though this effect is damp- ened in the euro area by the fact that the Eurosystem does not only purchase the assets from domestic non-banks. There are also indirect effects resulting from the transmission of the pur- chase programme and its impact on lending and portfolio allocation. Critics point to the banking system's capacity to create money as one of the main culprits behind destabilising nancial cycles and nancial crises, hence the long-standing debate about pro- posals to fully back deposits with central bank money, a move intended to restrict the extent to which the banking sector can create credit. It is not evident, however, that these constraints do indeed make for a nancial system that is more stable overall than might in any case be achieved through targeted regulatory action. At the same time, that kind of transition to a new system would risk impairing important functions which the banking system performs for the economy and are crucial for keeping real economic growth on a steady path.},

This paper argues that the expansion may, indeed, continue through 2004 and for some time beyond. But with the government and external deficits both so large and the private sector so heavily indebted, satisfactory growth in the medium term cannot be achieved without a large, sustained and discontinuous increase in net export demand. It is doubtful whether this will happen spontaneously and it certainly will not happen without a cut in domestic absorption of goods and services by the US which would impart a deflationary impulse to the rest of the world. We make no short term forecast. Instead, using a model rooted in a consistent system of stock and flow variables, we trace out a range of possible medium term scenarios in order to evaluate strategic predicaments and policy options without being at all precise about timing.},

Rising indebtedness increases the susceptibility of homeowners to housing and labor market restructuring, and if the degree of leverage is very high, can threaten the solvency, living standards, and social stability of local communities. However, very little is understood regarding how levels of household indebtedness are spatially distributed within or across cities, and how private debt maps onto the geography of race, class, housing, urban form, and other social variables, especially outside of the United States. It remains unknown whether and how higher and unsustainable levels of indebtedness might be associated with urban growth, decline, suburbanization, gentrification, immigration, racialization, and/or greying.

abstract = {In this study we tried to detect the determinants of non-performing loans for a sample of 85 banks in three countries (Italy, Greece and Spain) for the period of 2004-2008. These countries have faced financial problems after the subprime crisis on 2008. The variables used are macroeconomic variables and specific variables to the bank. The macroeconomic variables are included the rate of growth of GDP, unemployment rate and real interest rate with respect to specific variables opted for the return on assets, the change in loans and the loan loss reserves to total loans ratio (LLR/TL). After the application of the method of panel data, we found the problem loans vary negatively with the growth rate of GDP, the profitability of banks' assets and positively with the unemployment rate, the loan loss reserves to total loans and the real interest rate. 1. Introduction The deterioration in the quality of the loan portfolio of banks was the main cause of problems in the banking system and in financial crises in developed economies. Indeed, the increase in loan defaults, banking mortgage in the United States, underlines the links between macroeconomic and financial shocks and the relationship between the friction in the credit market and the risk of financial instability. The theme of "non-performing loans" (NPL) has attracted more attention in recent decades. Several studies examined bank failures and find that asset quality is an indicator of insolvency (Demirguc-Kunt, 1989; Barr and Siems, 1994). Banks still have a high level of impaired loans before the bankruptcy. Therefore, the large amount of bad loans in the banking system generally results in a bank failure. The NPL are among the main causes of the problems of economic stagnation. Each impaired loan in the financial sector increases the possibility to lead company to difficulty and unprofitability. The minimization of NPL is a necessary condition for improving economic growth. When NPL retained permanently, these will have an impact on the resources that are enclosed in unprofitable areas. Thus, NPL are likely to hamper economic growth and reduce the economic efficiency (Hou, 2007). The shocks to the financial system can arise from factors specific to the company (idiosyncratic shocks) or macroeconomic imbalances (systemic shocks). In general, the researches adopted in the developed economies have confirmed that macroeconomic conditions affect credit risk. Initially, this study proposes to know the factors that explain the quality of loans granted by the bank, specifically bad debts. These factors may include macroeconomic and bank-specific variables. The rest of this paper is arranged as follows: the second section discusses the existing literature on the determinants of NPL namely macroeconomic and bank-specific variables and the effect on the quality of loans. The third section describes the data used and the methodology. The fourth section interprets and analyzes the empirical results. Finally, the conclusion will be the fifth section.},

abstract = {Rising inequality affects the composition of asset demands as well as aggregate demand. The poor have few financial assets and their portfolios are skewed towards fixed-income assets. The rich, by contrast, hold a large proportion of their wealth in stocks. Thus, an increase in inequality tends to raise the demand for stocks. This generates capital gains, and these gains can fuel a bubble, as desired portfolios shift further towards stocks.},

abstract = {AbstractMainstream macroeconomics has pursued ‘micro founded' models based on the explicit optimization by representative agents. The result has been a long and wasteful detour. But elements of the Lucas critique are relevant, also for heterodox economists. Challenging common heterodox views on microeconomics and formalization, this paper argues that (i) economic models should not be based purely on empirically observed regularities, (ii) heterodox economists must be able to tell an integrated story about goal-oriented micro behavior in a specific macro environment, and (iii) relatively simple analytical models have an essential role to play.},

Financial literacy is lower among low-income and immigrant households as well as among women. Young households seem to be less familiar with the concept of inflation, while retirees are less familiar with the concepts of compound interest and risk diversification.

abstract = {The effect of wealth on consumption is an issue of long-standing interest to economists. Conventional wisdom suggests that fluctuations in household wealth have driven major swings in economic activity both in the United States and abroad. This paper considers the so-called consumption wealth effects. There is an extensive existing literature on wealth effects that has yielded some insights. For example, research has documented the relationship between aggregate household wealth and aggregate consumption over time, and a large number of household-level studies suggest that wealth effects are larger for households facing credit constraints. However, there are also many unresolved issues regarding the influence of household wealth on consumption.We review the most important of these issues and argue that there is a need for much more research in these areas as well as better data sources for conducting such analysis.},

We maintain that the thrust of the paradox of debt-based criticism to Minsky's theory has been exaggerated and key insights of Minsky's theory of financial instability can be formalized in an alternative macroeconomic framework.

abstract = {This paper presents the first empirical evidence in the history of banking on the question of whether banks can create money out of nothing. The banking crisis has revived interest in this issue, but it had remained unsettled. Three hypotheses are recognised in the literature. According to the financial intermediation theory of banking, banks are merely intermediaries like other non-bank financial institutions, collecting deposits that are then lent out. According to the fractional reserve theory of banking, individual banks are mere financial intermediaries that cannot create money, but collectively they end up creating money through systemic interaction. A third theory maintains that each individual bank has the power to create money 'out of nothing' and does so when it extends credit (the credit creation theory of banking). The question which of the theories is correct has far-reaching implications for research and policy. Surprisingly, despite the longstanding controversy, until now no empirical study has tested the theories. This is the contribution of the present paper. An empirical test is conducted, whereby money is borrowed from a cooperating bank, while its internal records are being monitored, to establish whether in the process of making the loan available to the borrower, the bank transfers these funds from other accounts within or outside the bank, or whether they are newly created. This study establishes for the first time empirically that banks individually create money out of nothing. The money supply is created as 'fairy dust' produced by the banks individually, "out of thin air".},

abstract = {This article interprets the initial success of the launch of the euro and its ‘muddling through' since the outbreak of the Greek sovereign debt crisis. Two interrelated processes interacted to deliver a quite complex idiosyncratic systemic crisis. First, new classical macroeconomics had diffused the belief that market economies are structurally stable, money is neutral, financial markets are efficient and that the only culprit is public finance. The euro crisis was thus inaccurately diagnosed. Second, in the political arena, monetary integration has been used by many governments as a justification for liberalisation reforms opposed by various domestic social groups. At the European level, most governments have been defending national interests, whereas the European Commission and European Parliament had lost most of their expertise and legitimacy in defending a common community in line euro ambitions. Crisis resolution calls for leadership from a key collective actor, to return coherence to the eurozone's institutional setting. Key},

In our model, workers first make consumption decisions based on their gross income, and then treat debt servicing commitments as a substitute for saving. Workers' borrowing is induced by their desire to keep up with the consumption standard set by rentiers' consumption, reflecting an aspect of the relative income hypothesis. As a result of this consumption and debt servicing behavior, consumer debt accumulation and income distribution have effects on aggregate demand, profitability, and economic growth that differ from those found in existing models. We also investigate the financial sustainability of the Golden Age and Neoliberal growth regimes within our framework. It is shown that distributional changes between the Golden Age and the Neoliberal regimes, together with corresponding changes in consumption emulation behavior via expenditure cascades, suffice to make the Neoliberal growth regime unsustainable.},

It is shown that the endogenous change in the desired margins of safety of firms and banks is likely to transform an otherwise stable debt-burdened economy into an unstable one. The endogeneity of the desired margins of safety can also produce, under certain conditions, investment and leverage cycles during which investment and leverage move both in the same and in the opposite direction. Furthermore, the paper investigates the potential stabilising role of fiscal policy. It is indicated that fiscal policy can reduce the destabilising forces in the macroeconomy when government expenditures adjust adequately to variations in the divergence between the actual and the desired margins of safety. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We construct an endogenous growth model of directed technical change with automation (the introduction of machines which replace low-skill labor and complement high-skill labor) and horizontal innovation (the introduction of new products, which increases demand for both types of labor). For general processes of technical change, we demonstrate that although low-skill wages can drop during periods of increasing automation intensity, the asymptotic growth rate is weakly positive --- though lower than that of the economy. We then endogenize the evolution of technology and show that the transitional path follows three distinct phases. First, wages are low, such that few machines are used and low-skill wages keep pace with the growth rate of the economy. Then, as wages grow, the share of automated products increases and the economy substitutes towards the use of machines -- depressing the growth rate of low-skill wages (potentially to negative). Finally, as the economy reaches steady state, the share of automated products is constant and the relative growth rate of low-skill wages recovers somewhat, yet remains lower than that of the economy overall. Allowing workers to endogenously transition from low-skill to high-skill alleviates the growth in income inequality, but does not alter the structure of the model. We extend the model to include middle-skill workers and demonstrate that the model endogenously captures the defining characteristics of the U.S. income distribution over the past 50 years: initially a monotone dispersion of the income distribution, and thereafter a wage growth polarization in which middle-skill workers experience the lowest wage growth. Finally, in an extension we allow machines to be produced with a different technology than the consumption good. This allows for faster productivity growth for machines potentially leading to permanently negative growth of low-skill wages.},

abstract = {In recent years, there has been a revival of concerns that automation and digitalisation might after all result in a jobless future. The debate has been fuelled by studies for the US and Europe arguing that a substantial share of jobs is at "risk of computerisation". These studies follow an occupation-based approach proposed by Frey and Osborne (2013), i.e. they assume that whole occupations rather than single job-tasks are automated by technology. As we argue, this might lead to an overestimation of job automatibility, as occupations labelled as high-risk occupations often still contain a substantial share of tasks that are hard to automate. Our paper serves two purposes. Firstly, we estimate the job automatibility of jobs for 21 OECD countries based on a task-based approach. In contrast to other studies, we take into account the heterogeneity of workers{\&}{\#}8217; tasks within occupations. Overall, we find that, on average across the 21 OECD countries, 9 {\%} of jobs are automatable. The threat from technological advances thus seems much less pronounced compared to the occupation-based approach. We further find heterogeneities across OECD countries. For instance, while the share of automatable jobs is 6 {\%} in Korea, the corresponding share is 12 {\%} in Austria. Differences between countries may reflect general differences in workplace organisation, differences in previous investments into automation technologies as well as differences in the education of workers across countries.},

Keynes's most explicit treatment was in the early drafts of the General Theory, unfortunately the final version dropped some of the clearest statements. Veblen's best known exposition was in the Theory of Business Enterprise. This paper will provide a concise summary of Veblen's views on the “credit economy,” comparing that with Keynes's “monetary economy.” While there are many similarities, Veblen's version is in some important respects more complete, and still relevant for developing an understanding of modern business practice. On one hand, this is not surprising as Keynes had let many of the monetary details “fall into the background.” However, as Matthew Wilson (2006) argues, it is surprising that most followers of Keynes have not mined the Theory of Business Enterprise for arguments that nicely complement and extend Keynes's better known approach.},

abstract = {What does the rise of shadow banking mean for monetary theory and practice? (How) should we change our traditional theories of money to capture the complex practices through which money is created in modern financial systems? To answer these questions, we approach money as provisional promises to pay, promises hierarchical in nature (Minsky 1998, Bell-Kelton 2001, Wray 2003, Mehrling 2012a, Mehrling et al 2013, Pozsar 2014, 2015). Noting that shadow banking is distinctive from relationship banking in that debt relationships are typically organized via marketable securities, we define shadow money as repo liabilities supported by tradable collateral. It is the presence of collateral characterising such private promises to pay that confer shadow money its distinctive character. In modern money hierarchies, market participants have developed an intricate mechanism for maintaining the exchange of money proper (state and bank money) with shadow money, a mechanism that essentially relies on the liquidity of the underlying collateral. We examine the dynamic properties of hierarchies with shadow money, and the systemic liquidity challenges that central banks face in stabilizing shadow money.},

abstract = {Goodwin cycles result from the dynamic interaction between a profit-led demand regime and a reserve army effect in income distribution. The paper proposes the concept of a pseudo- Goodwin cycle. We define this as a counter-clockwise movement in output and wage share space which is not generated by the usual Goodwin mechanism. In particular, it does not depend on a profit-led demand regime. As a demonstration, a simple Minsky model is extended by adding a reserve army distribution adjustment mechanism. The wage share responds positively to output but generates no feedback. In the augmented Minsky model, cycles are generated purely through the interaction between financial fragility and demand. By design, demand is not influenced by changes in income distribution. But the model does exhibit a pseudo-Goodwin cycle in the output-wage share space. This holds true even if a wage-led demand regime is introduced. This demonstrates that the existence of a counter-clockwise movement of output and the wage share cannot be regarded as proof of the existence of a Goodwin cycle and a profit-led demand regime.},

@article{orrell2016,
abstract = {The answer to the question 'what is money?' has changed throughout history. During the Gold Standard era, money was seen as gold or silver (the theory known as bullionism). In the early 20 th century, the alternative theory known as chartalism proposed that money was a token chosen by the state for payment of taxes. Today, many economists take an agnostic line, and argue that money is best defined in terms of its function, e.g. as a neutral medium of exchange. This paper argues that none of these approaches adequately describes the nature of money, and proposes a new theory, inspired by non-Newtonian physics, which takes into account the dualistic real/virtual properties and complex nature of money. The theory is applied to the example of the emergence of cybercurrencies. .},

From a perspective that focuses on the value and$\backslash$nvolume of gross domestic product, that assessment is valid. The world's major economies enjoyed a$\backslash$nsustained period of growth.

This framework is used to shine a different light on the$\backslash$nGreat Moderation in the United Kingdom. It suggests that there were linkages between many of the$\backslash$nmacroeconomic puzzles of the day and the balance sheet developments that led to financial$\backslash$ninstability. It further argues that approaches to macroeconomics that stress the importance of$\backslash$nbalance sheet linkages might be helpful in spotting building financial fragility.},

abstract = {1 " If we are wrong and high profit margins manage to endure for the next few years (particularly when global demand growth is below trend), there are broader questions to be asked about the efficacy of capitalism. " -Goldman Sachs investors' note, February 3, 2016, as quoted in Bloomberg News Executive Summary Academics and policymakers have recently focused on a worsening economic phenomenon commonly referred to as the decline in " business dynamism, " that is, the declining rate at which new businesses are formed and the rate at which they grow. This decline in dynamism and entrepreneurship accompanies a decline in overall labor market mobility, including quits and geographic migration for work, and has sparked a new literature on the subject by researchers including the Chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisors and numerous other academics, as well as extensive journalistic coverage. However, most of these analyses stress supply-side factors such as excessive occupational licensing and restrictions on building new housing. The data reject these supply-side interpretations, so this paper provides an alternative explanation for the recent trends of declining entrepreneurship, falling labor mobility, and rising concentration of employment in old firms and large firms. The erosion in labor mobility and entrepreneurship since 2000 can be more accurately explained by weak demand, especially during the slow recovery from the two previous recessions. These economic trends, in turn, should be investigated and understood through a lens of power shifting in favor of the owners and managers of incumbent firms alongside rising profits and inter-firm inequality.},

abstract = {Abstract The global financial crisis has reaffirmed the importance of financial factors for macroeconomic fluctuations. Recent work has shown how the conventional pre-crisis prescription that monetary policy should pay no attention to financial variables over and above their effects on inflation may no longer be valid in models that consider frictions in financial intermediation (C{\'{u}}rdia and Woodford, 2009). This paper analyzes whether Taylor rules augmented with asset prices and credit can improve upon a standard rule both in terms of macroeconomic stabilization and of agents׳ welfare in a DSGE with both a firms׳ balance-sheet channel and a bank-lending channel and in which the spread between lending and policy rates endogenously depends on banks׳ leverage. The main result is that, even in a model in which financial stability does not represent a distinctive policy objective, leaning-against-the-wind policies are desirable in the case of supply side shocks, while strict inflation targeting and a standard rule are less effective. The gains are amplified if the economy is characterized by high private sector indebtedness. Robustness shows that the interaction between financial frictions and debt-deflation effects is potentially very powerful.},

abstract = {With the use of non-traditional policy tools, the level of reserve balances has risen in the US from roughly {\$}20 billion before the financial crisis to well past {\$}1 trillion. The effect of reserve balances in macroeconomic models often comes through the money multiplier, affecting the money supply and the bank lending. In this paper, we document that the mechanism does not work through the standard multiplier model or the bank lending channel. If the level of reserve balances is expected to have an impact on the economy, it seems unlikely that a standard multiplier story will explain the effect.},

abstract = {Paul Davidson has criticized Babylonian thought as supporting an "anything goes" approach to Post Keynesian economics. This note explains Babylonian thought, not as the dual of classical logic but as another form of logic that is rigorous in light of the nonergodic nature of social systems, and the uncertainty this entails. It is argued that Babylonian thought is one way of understanding Keynes's "ordinary logic," while Davidson's use of the term "axiomatic" appears problematic. But the ergodic axiom is so compatible with the open-systems ontology on which Babylonian thought is based that there is, in fact, scope for broad agreement.},

abstract = {Lima and Setterfield (2008) showed that it is possible to make inflation targeting compatible with an essentially Post Keynesian economy, yet they considered the process of expectations formation with exogenous credibility. This work reconstructs all of the Lima and Setterfield models, considering an endogenous process for explaining credibility. The results confirm that the combinations of Post Keynesian policies have a large capacity to lead the economy toward the desired levels of output and inflation, while orthodox policies are generally incompatible with the Post Keynesian environment. A novel finding is that convergence for the output and inflation targets also means that maximum credibility is obtained and that appropriate policies avoid systematic forecasting errors, which cause a crisis of confidence.},

The purchasing power of ordinary workers and consumers has been constrained by the evolution of six economic features: environmental issues, globalization, sound finance, the focus of central banks on inflation, and the new views on corporate governance, based on shareholder value and money manager capitalism. The generalization of securitization also played a large negative role—a role that was not well identified by heterodox economists.},

abstract = {This paper discusses Modern Money Theory (MMT) with a particular focus on the role of the state in its monetary system and the nature of money. It addresses the main differences between the orthodox, heterodox and MMT approaches to monetary theory while reconciling endogenous money theory with the state money approach. By emphasising the symmetry between how banks create money as they finance private spending and how the government creates money when it finances its own spending, we clarify some of the misconceptions surrounding MMT while showing that it is more consistent with the facts of experience. Furthermore, we argue that MMT's insistence that government spending or lending must precede bond sales is consistent with the Keynesian emphasis on effective demand as the driving force behind income and saving. We delve into MMT's implications for monetary and fiscal policy, with a particular focus on the eurozone. We conclude our paper by discussing two proposals of ‘monetary cranks': narrow banking and government issue of debt-free money. This allows us to re-emphasise MMT's views on the nature of money.},

abstract = {Drawing on monetary circuit theory, this study develops an approach to analyze the integrated functions of banking and finance in a monetary production economy. The study proposes a micro-founded, circuit-sequenced model of a decentralized-decisions economy, where production, exchange, and investment from households and firms are integrated through money creation and funds allocation operated, respectively, by banks and non-bank financial intermediaries. The model is used to draw implications on: the special nature of banks and the role of non-bank financial intermediaries; the relationship between saving and investment; and the channels through which finance may cause the circuit process to break down. The study also discusses how the circuit approach can be used for an integrated analysis of economic and financial structural change.},

abstract = {This paper investigates how monetary policy should be conducted in a two-region general equilibrium model with monopolistic competition and price stickiness. This framework delivers a simple welfare criterion based on the utility of the consumers that can be used to evaluate monetary policy in a currency area. If the two regions share the same degree of nominal rigidity, the terms of trade are completely insulated from monetary policy and the optimal outcome is obtained by targeting a weighted average of the regional inflation rates. These weights coincide with the economic sizes of the region. If the degrees of rigidity are different, the optimal plan implies a high degree of inertia in the inflation rate. But an inflation targeting policy in which higher weight is given to the inflation in the region with higher degree of nominal rigidity is nearly optimal.},

The purpose of this paper is to address issues of meaning that arise in this particular discourse, with a view to clarifying both conflicts in usage and the underlying issues involved. We explore the different meanings of openness and closure extant in the literature, as applied at the ontological and epistemological levels, focusing on our own use of the terms in relation to that which prevails in neoclassical economics on the one hand and to the use made of them by Tony Lawson and other critical realists on the other.

This is the spatial/geographic counterpart of the currently dominating model of the nature and evolution of money, here termed M theory, whereby money is viewed as having developed from a private sector cost minimisation process to facilitate trading. Here, I argue, first, that there is a second, cartalist, or C theory alternative, which is empirically more compelling. Second, I claim that this approach can predict observed relationships between sovereign countries and their currencies better than the OCA model.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study the interaction between macroeconomic environment and firms' balance sheet effects in Brazil during the 1990's. We start by assessing the influence of macroeconomic conditions on firms' debt composition in Brazil. We found that larger firms tend to change debt currency composition more in response to a change in the exchange rate risk. We then proceed to investigate if and how exchange rate balance sheet effects affected the firms' investment decisions. We test directly the exchange rate balance sheet effect on investment, but the results were not statistically significant. We then pursue an alternative investigation strategy, inspired by the credit channel literature. According to this perspective, Tobin's q can provide an adequate control for the competitiveness effect on investment. Our results provide supporting evidence for imperfect capital markets, but not for a balance sheet effect in Brazil. The main effect we found is that firms in industries with higher proportion of imported inputs tend to invest less when the exchange rate is depreciated.},

abstract = {As creators of credit money, commercial banks prevent the nonfinancial private sector from being constrained by its prior savings in accordance with the theory of the monetary circuit. Commercial banking provides the means for a private economy to break away from its financial constraint. Commercial banks are a blend of private/public institutions at the foundation of an economy's payment system, with the accompanying critical externalities. As the economy has moved historically from the prefinancialization era toward a hyperfinancialized economy, there has been a shift away from its traditional role of financing production. The activity of commercial banking has evolved, especially as a result of securitization. Commercial banks are now found at the center of one large profit-making transactions machine that largely denies their original role in the productive sphere. It is their new activities, together with all the associated perverse incentives that this transformation has created, that brought about the financial crisis. The article analyzes this evolution by studying more carefully the Canadian experience prior to and following the financial crisis.},

abstract = {Abstract This study investigates the impact of monetary policy shocks on the exchange rates of Brazil, Mexico and Chile. We find that even a focus on 1 day exchange rate changes following policy events – which reduces the potential for reverse causality considerably – fails to lend support for the view that associates unexpected interest rate hikes with immediate appreciations. This lack of empirical backing for the predictions of standard open economy models persists irrespective of whether we use the US Dollar or effective exchange rates, whether changes in the policy rate that were followed by exchange rate interventions are excluded, whether “contaminated” events are dropped from the analysis or whether we allow for non-linearities. We argue that it is difficult to attribute this stronger version of the exchange rate puzzle to fiscal dominance, as unexpected rate increases are not associated with increases in risk premia, and similar results are obtained in the case of Chile – a country that has had the highest possible short-term credit rating since 1995 and a debt/GDP ratio below 10{\%}.},

Since exchange rate volatility contributes to inflation volatility, we conjecture that it could have a direct effect on domestic consumption. We demonstrate our conjecture by specifying a consumption function that includes a measure of exchange rate volatility, in addition to its usual determinants. The model is estimated for each of the 17 countries in the sample using the bounds-testing approach to cointegration and error-correction modeling. The results reveal that in 12 of the countries, exchange rate volatility has short-run effects on consumption. Long-run effects are observed in only 9 countries.},

abstract = {The current crisis is one outcome of the financialisation of contemporary capitalism. It arose in the USA because of the enormous expansion of mortgage-lending, including to the poorest layers of the working class. It became general because of the trading of debt by financial institutions. These phenomena are integral to financialisation. During the last three decades, large enterprises have turned to open markets to obtain finance, forcing banks to seek alternative sources of profit. One avenue has been provision of financial services to individual workers. This trend has been facilitated by the retreat of public provision from housing, pensions, education, and so on. A further avenue has been to adopt investment-banking practices in open financial markets. The extraction of financial profits directly out of personal income constitutes financial expropriation. Combined with investment-banking, it has catalysed the current gigantic crisis. More broadly, financialisation has sustained the emergence of new layers of rentiers, defined primarily through their relation to the financial system rather than ownership of loanable capital. Finally, financialisation has posed important questions regarding finance-capital and imperialism.

abstract = {This paper outlines new developments in the sociology of money. It highlights certain aspects of Post Keynesian monetarism and explores Keynesian concepts of emotions relative to economics and economic sociology. Gunnar Myrdal's work on time and money contributes to the discussion. Underdeveloped areas of discourse in both sociology and economics are identified and the resulting superficiality of references to money are examined. Sociology, for example, has historically neglected concepts of future time and money, while economics has paid little attention to emotions and organizations. Removing these orthodox barriers allows economics to be informed by concepts previously relegated to sociology, such as emotions of trust and confidence. This process may induce the disaffected from both disciplines to draw from each other, creating an alternative, and ultimately more satisfactory understanding of money.},

abstract = {What might happen if a third-party entity had the power to implement fiscal reforms and/or punish sovereign debt defaulters? In contrast to recent history, extreme sanctions such as gunboat diplomacy and “fiscal house arrest” were used to punish debt defaulters during the period 1870–1913. We find that, after a “supersanction” was imposed, a country improved its fiscal discipline. As a result, ex ante default probabilities on new issues fell dramatically and the country spent no additional time in default. Our results suggest some type of external fiscal or monetary control may be effective in imposing discipline on serial debt defaulters.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the predictive ability of money for future inflation in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia. We construct monetary indicators similar to those the European Central Bank regularly uses for monetary analysis. We find in-sample evidence that money matters for future inflation at the policy horizons that central banks typically focus on, but our pseudo out-of-sample forecasting exercise shows that money does not in general improve the inflation forecasts vis-{\`{a}}-vis some benchmark models such as the autoregressive process. Since at least some models containing money improve the inflation forecasts in certain periods, we argue that money still serves as a useful cross-check for monetary policy analysis.},

abstract = {We examine the role of public debt in financial development. The literature has highlighted its supportive role through providing collateral and benchmark. We contrast this “safe asset” view to a “lazy banks” view: developing banking sectors that lend mainly to the public sector may develop more slowly, because it could make banks profitable but inefficient. Results from country-level and bank-level regressions are more supportive of the “lazy banks” view, but the “safe asset” view seems to play a role at moderate levels of public debt held by banks. There is also evidence of a harmful interaction between public debt and financial repression.},

abstract = {This paper explains why public domestic debt composition in emerging economies can be risky, namely in foreign currency, with a short maturity or indexed. It analyses empirically the determinants of these risk sources separately, developing a new large dataset compiled from national sources for 33 emerging economies over 1994–2006. The paper finds that economic size, the breadth of the domestic investor base, inflation and fiscal soundness are all associated with risky public domestic debt compositions, yet to an extent that varies considerably in terms of magnitude and significance across sources of risk. Only inflation impacts all types of risky debt, underscoring the overarching importance of monetary credibility to make domestic debt compositions in emerging economies safer. Given local bond markets' rapid development, monitoring risky public domestic debt compositions in emerging economies becomes increasingly relevant to global financial stability.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to discuss the processes of financial and economic unification that led to the emergence of the Greenback, as the single currency of the US , and the Euro as the single currency in the European Union. It will then discuss the issues related to a single global currency in the context of the IMF's promotion of global financial stability as one of the key global public goods. The conditions associated with the theory of the “optimum currency area” including asymmetric shocks and the mobility of capital and labor are analysed in the context of the processes of globalisation and international security. The paper indicates that the mobility of capital, active participation of MNCs and institutional foreign shareholding have created a global economy in which capital now meets labor rather than, as in earlier decades, labor migrating to locations offering employment, which in turn has significant implications for the conditions attached to a global single currency.},

abstract = {There have been large changes in the conduct of aggregate demand policy in the United States over the past fifty years. This paper shows that these changes in policy have resulted largely from changes in policymakers' beliefs about the functioning of the economy and the effects of policy. We document the changes in beliefs using contemporaneous discussions of the economy and policy by monetary and fiscal policymakers and, for the period since the late 1960s, using the Federal Reserve's internal forecasts. We find that policymakers' understanding of the economy has not exhibited steady improvement. Instead, the evidence reveals an evolution from a fairly crude but basically sound worldview in the 1950s, to a more sophisticated but deeply flawed model in the 1960s, to uncertainty and fluctuating beliefs in the 1970s, and finally to the modern worldview of the 1980s and 1990s. We establish a link between policymakers' beliefs and aggregate demand policy by examining narrative evidence on the motivation for key policy choices. We also compare monetary policymakers' choices with the implications of a modern estimated policy rule and show that the main differences are consistent with the changes in beliefs that we observe.},

abstract = {Since the outbreak of the subprime mortgage crisis, the benefits of securitization have started to be questioned. Originally, securitization was meant to improve the efficiency of capital markets by reducing risks through risk tiering and geographic diversification. It has also been considered to have contributed to a reduction in transaction costs and greater flexibility in financial operations. As it turns out, it seems to have played a major role in fueling the dynamics of the subprime mortgage crisis. This article aims at defining the role of securitization in the subprime mortgage crisis and, more broadly, in the current financial system.},

At issue is the contrast between a negative net-worth effect and a potential expansionary competitiveness effect for the tradable sector. We find that there exists little evidence that devaluations cause a positive impact on investment and sales for firms with dollar denominated debt. The maturity structure of Chilean firms is mainly explained by the size of the companies. Large firms will have a debt structure biased to higher maturities. Analyzing dollar denominated debt composition the evidence shows that larger firms maintained a higher proportion of dollar denominated debt reflecting the development of the financial sector in Chile.},

We also investigate what drives Mexican firms to borrow in foreign currency. We find that holding dollar denominated debt in a devaluation adversely affects firms' earnings and investment. However, exporters invested more than non-exporters in the same period. We also find that the negative effect of dollar debt was stronger than the positive effect of exports in the 1994 crisis for firms with positive dollar debt and/or exports, relative to firms that did not borrow abroad and/or export. This was a result of imperfect currency matching by firms. However, in the 1998 crisis firms managed the denominations of their inflows and outflows much better and these two effects were roughly equal in magnitude. We also find some evidence of currency matching by exporters, especially after the introduction of the floating exchange rate.},

These two concepts explain not only Minsky's financial instability hypothesis but also the off-balance-sheet operations represented by derivative products, which are closely related to mortgage loans. Financial intermediaries in need of inquidity did everything in their power so that the securitization of assets could have a life of its own in financial operations. This is a process that is endogenous to the development of financialization. Because said process was a violation of the monetary economy, it was necessary for central banks to intervene as "lenders of last resort" as well as to nationalize and restructure all the financial intermediaries.},

The intended contributions of the paper are twofold: it extends the Kaleckian model for an open economy to incorporate the effects of capital flows on the RER and interest rate, and it acknowledges the possibility of having different macroeconomic regimes that reflect different preferences for inflation and employment by the government. A monetary rule that considers its effects on both inflation and employment may be more conducive to stability than a regime that solely focuses on inflation. On the other hand, a regime that solely focuses on employment will be unstable if adaptive expectations prevail in the process of wage bargaining.},

It then asks: How did Federal Reserve policy produce an understanding of the practical principles of monetary policy? How did formal institutional support abroad for targeting low inflation follow from an international acceptance of these ideas? And how did a consensus theoretical model develop in academia? The article tells how the modern theoretical consensus known as the New Neoclassical Synthesis (aka, the New Keynesian model) reinforces key advances: the priority for price stability, the targeting of core rather than headline inflation, the importance of credibility for low inflation, and preemptive interest rate policy supported by transparent objectives and procedures. The conclusion identifies important practical issues that remain to be explored in theory.},

abstract = {This paper presents the current "state of the art" of Post Keynesian modeling, as well as the most important issues raised by it. We first present a new formal statement of Keynes's model. We then analyze the three most important classes of Post Keynesian contemporary models: the Kaleckian models of growth, the Minskian models showing the destabilizing effects of financial variables on the economy, and the path-dependent models insisting on the nature of time in economics, and on the absence of any "natural" anchor. We argue that, whereas the current Post Keynesian models have a lot in common with Keynes's model, none of them encompass all its rich and realistic properties, and a synthetic dynamic Post Keynesian model is desirable, and has still to be framed.},

abstract = {This study aims at unifying the empirical research on interest-rate pass-through in the euro zone. After endogenously determining structural breaks we select optimal pass-through models, which allow for thresholds and asymmetric adjustment. By applying these models to monetary policy shocks as well as cost-of-funds changes, we show that in post-break periods monetary policy transmission has become faster, that heterogeneity across the euro zone has decreased in some banking markets, and that more competition improves the pass-through predominantly in deposit markets. As national characteristics are still important pass-through determinants, convergence remains incomplete and monetary policy will continue to operate in a heterogeneous euro zone.},
